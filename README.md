# March2019ToV6Conversion
I created this repo to convert March2019 database to be compatible with saturn v6 patch. Once completed, I will probably delete this project from github.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
Very simple: 
Choose any of the unassigned [issues](https://github.com/MScientistCM/March2019ToV6Conversion/issues), assign it to yourself (to signalize you are working on it), and then push your changes to this github project (or just send me your changed files somehow).
