# March2019ToV6Conversion
I created this project to convert March2019 database to be compatible with saturn v6 patch. Once completed, I will probably delete this project from github.

HOW TO HELP:
The tasks can be done in any order. Choose any of the unassigned [tasks](https://github.com/MScientistCM/March2019ToV6Conversion/issues), assign it to yourself (to signalize you are working on it), and then push your changes to this github project (or if you don't want to use github, then just do any of the tasks and send me your changed files somehow).
